# microprcessor applications

This is my collection of labs from 3744 Microprocessor Applications. All code is written in C or assembly for the ATxMega line of processors.  Projects ranged from External Bus Interface (EBI) drivers, digital to analog and analog to digital converters, various communication protocol implementations, and even some games.
